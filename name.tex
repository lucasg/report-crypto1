\chapter{Miscellaneous}

In this chapter, we will cover various minor parts of cryptography which does not belong to the previous chapters, e.g. stenography, key derivation, deterministic encryption, ...

\section{Stenography}
% "Hide in plain sight"

\section{Key derivation}

\section{Deterministic Encryption}


\section{Arithmetic Algorithms}

In this section, we will discuss big integer manipulation. Most computer have 32/64-bit architecture, while cryptography typically handle hundreds-bits number : the operations like addition or multiplication are not atomic.

basic operations :
addition -> linear time
multiplication -> $O(n^(2))$ up to $O(n.log(n))$(asymptote). currently best : $O(n^{1.585})$.
division with remainder -> $O(n^(2))$


exponentiation in $Z_N$ -> $O( Multi*log(n) )$ <= $O(n^2.log(n) )
