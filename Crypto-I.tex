%\begin{flushleft}

These notes are based upon the free Coursera Course called "Cryptography I", teached by Dan Boneh from Standford, as well as information gathered from Wikipedia.\\
First, it's  a personal project from an amateur in the domain : it is not exempt from errors and imprecisions (as well as grammar/typos since I am not an native English speaker).\\
Second, the way the document is structured does not make it easy for a complete beginner to understand cryptography : I assume readers have to be somewhat proficient in mathematics and computer science to understand big-O notations, P/NP problems, and basic algebra (sets, group theory, etc.). \\

This document was written using ShareLatex, a powerful web-based editor, and shared using Github (lucasg/crypto-report1).
