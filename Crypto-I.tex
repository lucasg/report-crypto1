\vspace*{6cm}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.6\linewidth}
    \begin{flushright}
    These notes are based upon the free Coursera Course called "Cryptography I", teached by Dan Boneh from Standford, as well as information gathered from Wikipedia. It's  a personal project from an amateur in the domain : it is not exempt from errors and imprecisions. This document was written using ShareLatex, a really powerful web-based editor, and shared using Github (lucasg/crypto-report1).
