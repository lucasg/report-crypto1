( disclaimer : I still haven't cleared every media resource in the report for fair use. If
you happen to be the author of one of those resources, please write me up. )


Tex Files for complete report of Stanford Crypto I class on Coursera.



The file hierarchy is fairly flat : every file is used as input for CryptoI.tex.

To build the output (pdf, dvi, etc.), you need to call (pdf|xe)?(la)?tex on CryptoI.tex.
The pure latex+dvi solution does not work since vanilla latex does not support jpeg and png images

There is a shitload of modules used here, so take your time if you compile for
the first time. For the record, I've used Miktex+TexMaker on Windows and Linux
without any issues (like broken encoding, out of boundaries graphs, etc.)
